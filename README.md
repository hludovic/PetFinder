# PetFinder

The "PetFinder" application aims to help its users find their lost pets. In order to alert other users as effectively as possible, they will be offered a list of lost pet at the launch of the application that they can meet around their geographical position. If you think you have found an animal, you can report it to the owner by sending him a message that may contain a photo and a geographical location. For security measures, we offer the user the possibility to block the reception of a photo in his settings, sign a user who misuses hte messages, and block him so that you can no longer interact with him.
